## Installation
Currently, this package is only available on GitHub.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xmiaocat/von-neumann-transform
cd von-neumann-transform
pip install .
```
Alternatively, you can install in development mode with
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quickstart
```python
import numpy as np
from von_neumann_transform import VonNeumannTransform

NPOINTS = 4096  # length of the signal
W_MIN = 0.0  # minimum angular frequency
W_MAX = 5.0  # maximum angular frequency

# Your signal in the frequency domain
signal = np.random.rand(NPOINTS) + 1.0j * np.random.rand(NPOINTS)

# Create a Von Neumann Transform instance
vnt = VonNeumannTransform(NPOINTS, W_MIN, W_MAX)

# Compute the von Neumann representation of the signal
q_nm = vnt.transform(signal)

# Reconstruct the original signal from the von Neumann coefficients
signal_recon = vnt.inverse_transform(q_nm)
```

## Algorithmic Details
This section gives an overview of each method and its computational complexity.
Suppose the signal has length $N$. Then $k = \sqrt{N}$ chosen, so the
von Neumann representation is a $k \times k$ matrix.

### Signal Projection
The signal projection is defined as
```math
  \langle \alpha_{\omega_i t_j} | \epsilon \rangle
  = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \alpha^*_{\omega_i t_j}(\omega) \epsilon(\omega) \mathrm{d}\omega
```
where $\alpha_{\omega_i t_j}(\omega)$ are the von Neumann basis functions
```math
  \alpha_{\omega_n t_m}(\omega) 
  = \left(\frac{2\alpha}{\pi}\right)^{1/4} 
    \exp \left[ -\alpha (\omega - \omega_n)^2 - \mathrm{i} t_m (\omega - \omega_n)^2 \right]
```
and $\epsilon(\omega)$ is the signal in the frequency domain.

In the discrete world, the basis functions $\alpha_{\omega_n t_m}(\omega)$
are sampled at $N$ points in the frequency domain, and therefore has the
shape `(k, k, N)`. The projection is then computed as
```math
  \alpha_{nm} = \sum_{p=0}^{N-1} \alpha_{\omega_n t_m}(\omega_p) \epsilon(\omega_p)\,.
```
The time complexity of this operation is $\mathcal{O}(k^2 N)$.
The space complexity is also $\mathcal{O}(k^2 N)$ if the basis functions
are precomputed and stored. 

The basis functions can be factorised as
```math
  \begin{align}
  \alpha_{\omega_n t_m}(\omega) 
  &= \left(\frac{2\alpha}{\pi}\right)^{1/4} 
    \exp \left[ -\alpha (\omega - \omega_n)^2 \right] 
    \exp \left[ -\mathrm{i} t_m \omega \right]
    \exp \left[ \mathrm{i} t_m \omega_n \right] \\
  &=: \left(\frac{2\alpha}{\pi}\right)^{1/4} 
    \alpha_{\omega_n}(\omega) \alpha_{t_m}(\omega) \alpha_{\omega_n t_m}\,.
  \end{align}
```
The discretised version of the factors $\alpha_{\omega_n}(\omega)$,
$\alpha_{t_m}(\omega)$ and $\alpha_{\omega_n t_m}$ have the shapes
`(k, N)`, `(k, N)` and `(k, k)` respectively. This way, 
although the time complexity of the projection is still
$\mathcal{O}(k^2 N)$, the space complexity can be reduced to
$\mathcal{O}(k N)$.

The factorisation shows another way to compute the projection.
Because of the factor $\exp \left[ \mathrm{i} t_m \omega_n \right]$,
this projection can be viewed as the (inverse) Fourier transform of the
signal $\epsilon(\omega)$ multiplied by the factor $\alpha_{\omega_n}(\omega)$
with a phase correction afterwards.
This reduces the time complexity to $\mathcal{O}(k N \log N)$.

The computational complexity of all three methods is summarised in the table below:
| Method          | Time Complexity   | Space Complexity |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| direct (`BasisMethod.DIRECT`) | $\mathcal{O}(k^2 N) = \mathcal{O}(N^2)$ | $\mathcal{O}(k^2 N) = \mathcal{O}(N^2)$ |
| factorisation (`BasisMethod.FACTORISE`) | $\mathcal{O}(k^2 N) = \mathcal{O}(N^2)$ | $\mathcal{O}(k N) = \mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ |
| FFT-based (`BasisMethod.FFT`) | $\mathcal{O}(k N \log N) = \mathcal{O}(N^{3/2} \log N)$ | $\mathcal{O}(k N) = \mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ |

### Overlap Assembly & Solvers
Since there are in total $k\times k = N$ basis functions, the overlap
matrix
```math
  S_{(n,m),(i,j)} = \sqrt{\frac{2\alpha}{\pi}}
    \exp \left[ -\frac{\alpha}{2}(\omega_n - \omega_i)^2
                -\frac{1}{8\alpha}(t_j - t_m)^2 
                +\frac{\mathrm{i}}{2}(\omega_i - \omega_n)(t_j + t_m) \right]
```
has the dimension $N \times N$. Precomputing it and then solving the
linear system
```math
  \sum_{(i,j)} S_{(n,m),(i,j)} q_{(i,j)} = \langle \alpha_{nm} | \epsilon \rangle
```
directly would have a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ 
and a space complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$.
This can become quite expensive for signals with a large number of points,

In practice, the space is often the limiting factor. Therefore, the usual
approach would be to implement a matrix-vector operator
that computes the product of the overlap matrix with a vector
by evaluating and contracting every row of the overlap matrix
with the vector on-the-fly, and then use an iterative solver
like the conjugate gradient method to solve the linear system.
This approach has a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ per iteration
and a space complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, which is much more feasible
for large signals.
However, the repeated evaluation of the overlap matrix and
the matrix-vector product becomes very time-consuming.
This method is not implemented in this package.

Luckily, the overlap matrix has some structures that can be exploited.
This matrix is actually a **H**ermitian **P**ositive **D**efinite 
**B**lock **T**oeplitz matrix with **T**oeplitz-**H**ankel
Hadamard Product **B**locks (HPDBTTHB).
The block Toeplitz structure means that we only need the first
block row and the first block column of the matrix to construct the
entire matrix. Because of the hermiticity, we even only need the
first block column of the dimension $N \times k$.
Even better, the block Toeplitz stucture allows one to efficiently compute
the matrix-vector product by embedding the the matrix into a larger
$2N \times 2N$ block circulant matrix and then using batch FFTs to compute
the product in $\mathcal{O}(k^2 \log k)$ time.
This way, the expensive "ordinary" matrix-vector product only needs to be
computed on the much smaller blocks, thus reducing the time complexity
of the matrix-vector product to $\mathcal{O}(k^3)$.
Overall, the time complexity of this method is
$\mathcal{O}(k^3)$ and the space complexity is $\mathcal{O}(k^3)$.

In theory, the Toeplitz-Hankel hadamard product structure of the blocks
can be exploited further to reduce the time complexity of the 
matrix-vector product of blocks to $\mathcal{O}(k^2 \log k)$,
but this is not implemented in this package yet.

To accelerate the convergence, a circulant preconditioner is used 
in the iterative solver, which does not increase the time complexity 
for the iterative part but adds an additional $\mathcal{O}(k^4)$ 
overhead for the preparation of the preconditioner.

The computational complexity of the overlap assembly and solvers is summarised 
in the table below:
| Method          | Time Complexity   | Space Complexity |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| direct (`MatVecMethod.DIRECT`) | $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ | $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ |
| rows of overlap + iterative solver (not implemented) | $\mathcal{O}(m\cdot N^2)$ | $\mathcal{O}(N)$ |
| Toeplitz + iterative solver + preconditioner (`MatVecMethod.TOEPLITZ_MATMUL` or `MatVecMethod.TOEPLITZ_EINSUM`) | $\mathcal{O}(N^2 + m\cdot N^{3/2}$ | $\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ |

The variable $m$ is the number of iterations of the iterative solver.

### Signal Reconstruction
The signal reconstruction is simply the inverse of the signal projection,
and thus the same assortment of methods with the same computational
complexity applies.
